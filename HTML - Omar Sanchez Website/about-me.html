    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Colombian artist from BogotÃ¡, currently living in Australia. His work for
       the past 15 years has explored an array of pictorial styles, starting with
        religious art then figurative, landscape and abstract. He has experimented
         with stronger colours, blends of acrylic and oil, textures and volumes,
         and using different material to create his paintings. With free compositions
         and theme of colour, Omar includes and emerald in each of this paitings as a
         final flourish to the work. The emerald also represents a gemological sample
         taken from the heart of Colombian mountains.</p>
    <p><em>"When I return home, I gain inspiration for my art practice from the city's complexities. I also find inspiration in the colours and shapes in the urban environment".</em></p>
